üíº Business/Sales Side ‚Äì Problems Solved
1. ## Inventory Intelligence
Problem: Sales teams often lack real-time insights into which vehicles are available, in demand, or within popular price brackets.

Solution: The app enables quick filtering and visibility into available vehicles by fuel type and price, aiding stock control and sales strategy.

2. ## Targeted Selling
Problem: Without segmentation tools, it's difficult to tailor offers to specific customer needs (e.g., budget-conscious buyers vs. performance buyers).

Solution: Sales reps can use the app to identify vehicles matching customer preferences in real time.

3. ## Data-Driven Decision Making
Problem: Manual methods of analyzing which vehicles are selling or being searched for are time-consuming.

Solution: The app can be extended with analytics (e.g., filtering frequency, price trends) to inform marketing and pricing decisions.

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Customer Side ‚Äì Problems Solved
1. ## Overwhelming Choices
Problem: Customers browsing an unfiltered list of vehicles may feel overwhelmed by too many irrelevant options.

Solution: Filters help narrow choices to vehicles that fit their fuel preference and budget.

2. ## Efficient Comparison
Problem: Comparing vehicles across a wide price range without tools is time-consuming and confusing.

Solution: A clean, interactive display makes it easy to compare specs and prices.

3. ## Budget-Conscious Browsing
Problem: Users want to avoid seeing vehicles they can‚Äôt afford.

Solution: The price slider ensures only relevant, affordable options are shown.
